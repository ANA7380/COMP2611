# 1.Introduction
- Numbering System:
  - Decimal (Base 10)
    - 0 to 9
  - Binary (Base 2)
    - 0 or 1
  - Hexadecimal (Base 16)
    - from 0 to 9 then A, B, ..., F
- Bit sequence: A sequence of bits that work together to represent larger numbers.
- Binary to decimal:
  - The right-most digit represents $2^0$, to its left is $2^1$, $2^2$, ...
  - Sum up the powers of 2 if its corresponding digit is 1.
- Decimal to binary:
  - Continue divide the decimal value by 2 **Until the quotient is 0**, record the remainder. The binary value can be obtained by reading the remainder from bottom to top.
  - e.g. 34:
    - $34/2=17$ remain 0
    - $17/2=8$ remain 1
    - $8/2=4$ remain 0
    - $4/2=2$ remain 0
    - $2/2=1$ remain 0
    - $1/2=0$ remain 1
    - Binary value: $100010$
- Decimal to hexadecimal:
  - Continue divide the value by 16 **until the quotient is 0**. The hexadecimal is the remainder reading from bottom to top.
  - e.g. 280:
    - $280/16=17$ remain 8
    - $17/16=1$ remain 1
    - $1/16=0$ remain 1
    - Hexadecimal value: 118
- Size of **Memory of file** e.g. USB:
  - 1 Kilo/Mega/Giga/Tera/Peta is $2^{10}/2^{20}/2^{30}/2^{40}/2^{50}$
- Size of **Rate/Frequency**:
  - 1 Kilo/Mega/Giga/Tera/Peta is $10^3/10^6/10^9/10^{12}/10^{15}$
- B (Uppercase) represents Bytes. 1 Byte = 8 bits
  - 1 GB
- b (lowercase) represents bits
  - 2 Mbps
- A computer has:
  - Application software (Intangible)
    - Programs written in high level language
  - System software (Intangible)
    - **Compiler** translate high level language to machine code.
    - Operating system handle the input/output, manage memory and storage, also scheduling tasks and sharing resources.
  - Hardware (Tangible)
    - Processor, memory, I/O controllers etc.
- Levels of program code:
  - High level language
    - Productivity and portability
    - Understandable to human
  - Low level language (assembly language)
    - More abstract, with some textual representation of instructions.
    - Symbolic language
  - Machine code
    - Most abstract, only in binary digits
    - Encoded instructions and data
- Moore's Law: The number of transistors on microchips doubles every 2 years.
  - But decreasing nowadays due to physical limitations
