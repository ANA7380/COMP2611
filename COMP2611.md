- Numbering System:
  - Decimal (Base 10)
    - 0 to 9
  - Binary (Base 2)
    - 0 or 1
  - Hexadecimal (Base 16)
    - from 0 to 9 then A, B, ..., F
- Bit sequence: A sequence of bits that work together to represent larger numbers.
- Binary to decimal:
  - The right-most digit represents $2^0$, to its left is $2^1$, $2^2$, ...
  - Sum up the powers of 2 if its corresponding digit is 1.
- Decimal to binary:
  - Continue divide the decimal value by 2 **Until the quotion is 0**, record the remainder. The binary value can be obtained by reading remainder from bottom to top.
  - e.g. 34:
    - $34/2=17$ remain 0
    - $17/2=8$ remain 1
    - $8/2=4$ remain 0
    - $4/2=2$ remain 0
    - $2/2=1$ remain 0
    - $1/2=0$ remain 1
    - Binary value: $100010$
- Decimal to hexadecimal:
  - Continue divide the value by 16 **until the quotion is 0**. The hexadecimal is the remainder reading from bottom to top.
  - e.g. 280:
    - $280/16=17$ remain 8
    - $17/16=1$ remain 1
    - $1/16=0$ remain 1
    - Hexadecimal value: 118
